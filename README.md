# Mnist-Digit-Classifier-using-Tensorflow-in-python-
Here we are using the functionalities of Tesorflow to create a Hand written Digit classifier by training it over the mnist data base.

##MNIST Data Set
Some examples require MNIST dataset for training and testing. Don't worry, this dataset will automatically be downloaded when running the command. 
`mnist = input_data.read_data_sets("MNIST_data/", one_hot = True)`

MNIST is a database of handwritten digits, for a quick description of that dataset, you can check this notebook.

##Installation
To run them simply clone the repository 
`here comes a  link`

To run the jupyter notebook
`pip install --upgrade pip`
`pip install jupyter`

To run the code you are required to install Tensorflow
`pip install tensorflow`

__use pip3 if you are using python 3__
