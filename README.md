# Mnist-Digit-Classifier-using-Tensorflow-in-python-
Here we are using the functionalities of Tesorflow to create a Hand written Digit classifier by training it over the mnist data base.

## MNIST Data Set
Some examples require MNIST dataset for training and testing. Don't worry, this dataset will automatically be downloaded when running the command. 

`mnist = input_data.read_data_sets("MNIST_data/", one_hot = True)`

or you can just download and extract the data from MNIST_data folder and give it's path in `input_data.read_data_sets()` command.

MNIST is a database of handwritten digits, for a quick description of that dataset, you can check this notebook.
